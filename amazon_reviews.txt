 Is it an authentic brand?
Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2023
Color: WhiteStyle: Buds2 Pro OnlyVerified Purchase
I'm doubting the authenticity of this product. I previously had this exact model of Buds but bought it from a big consumer electronics retailer, let's call them BestBite. Because I fly often, I accidentally forgot them on the plane and lost my favorite pair. Because I loved the product so much, I decided to order this one. Immediately I noticed the difference in sound quality and after only 2 months of use, the left and right buds do not sound the same. The right is muffled and I've updated the software and did a bunch of troubleshooting and nothing helps. It now sits at home and had replaced it with another one from BestBite

 Hair activating touch controls/good ANC
Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023
Color: WhiteStyle: Buds2 Pro OnlyVerified Purchase
The wearable app is only good for android. NOT iPhone!!! I am planning to borrow a friend’s android to see if I can edit the touch controls, but for now I can only review the basics of these buds:
Pros: sound and ANC are really good! The comfort is good.
Cons: app only for android.
BIG CON: if you have long hair and if it is at all damp or wet, it constantly activates the touch controls and turns off or changes the music/sounds. It would be lovely for the customizable configuration to have a tap feature to temporarily deactivate or decrease sensitivity.
I read in another review this is a problem with other wireless. Uds, so I May just keep these.

 Did Not Fit My Ears, Poor Battery Life
Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2023
Color: WhiteStyle: Buds2 Pro OnlyVerified Purchase
They kept falling out of my ears even when I tried other ear tips. Battery life was disappointing. I replaced them with the much better Anker Soundcore buds which have better battery life, fit better, seal better, cost less, and have better noise canceling. I also did not like the touch controls on the Samsung buds AR all while the Soundcore have a squeeze control which is much harder to activate by accident.

 Great Buds, Bad Case
Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023
Color: WhiteStyle: Buds2 Pro OnlyVerified Purchase
First of all, the actual earbuds are amazing. Good sound, great noise cancelling, excellent integration with my Samsung phone.




The problem turned out to be the case. Two months after purchase, it stopped charging the left earbud. Sent to Samsung for repairs, but it was going to cost almost as much as just buying a whole new set of earbuds. Will not be wasting my money on more of these.

 Short battery life and connection issues
Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2023
Color: WhiteStyle: Buds2 Pro OnlyVerified Purchase
Headphones die within 4 hours of use, they charge fairly fast but still leads to juggling one earbud at a time. The case battery is also disappointingly small as well (maybe 3 charges) with no clear indicator of when the charge is low unless you go to the app. The earbuds also disconnect and reconnect at random times. Passive mode constantly changes levels to ambients sounds that's really distracting.

 Good, but they cut my ear

These are great sound quality. But the right one cuts my ear up with the little pieces near the charging spots.

My wife likes it and that is all that matters. But when I tested it the sound was very bad and the noise cancelling is not great.

I returned this item. The left bud often failed to connect to the Bluetooth. Can’t forward to the next song or adjust sound quality with an iPhone.
